My name is Usman Taiwo, I'm a graduate of Microbiology still at a lost on what to do with the degree. 
I'm an avid sleeper that enjoys good books and poetry.
I'm passionate about women empowerment and social justice.
I enjoy drinking coffee even though it's bad for my health
I hope to learn enough programming and be good at it enough to make a career out of it.
